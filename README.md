# Install

SamplerBox works with the RaspberryPi's built-in soundcard, but it is recommended to use a USB DAC (PCM2704 USB DAC for less than 10â‚¬ on eBay is fine) for better sound quality. 

You can use a ready-to-use ISO image from the [Releases](https://github.com/josephernest/SamplerBox/releases) page or do a manual install:

0. Start with a standard RaspiOS intsall. The following steps have been tested with ADD NEW VERSION HERE!!! [2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip).

1. Install the required dependencies (Python-related packages and audio libraries - the current version required specifically Python 3.7 as rtmidi-python uses code which was removed in python 3.8):

    ~~~
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt -y install git python3-pip python3-smbus python3-numpy libportaudio2 libasound2-dev
    sudo apt -y install raspberrypi-kernel  # quite long to install, do it only if necessary, it solves a "no sound before 25 second on boot" problem
    sudo pip3 install cython python-rtmidi cffi sounddevice pyserial
    ~~~
    
2. Download SamplerBox and build it with:

    ~~~
    git clone https://github.com/josephernest/SamplerBox.git
    cd SamplerBox
    sudo python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
    ~~~

3. Reboot the Pi, and run the soft with: 
    
    ~~~
    sudo python3 samplerbox.py
    ~~~

    Play some notes on the connected MIDI keyboard, you'll hear some sound!

4. *(Optional)*  Modify `config.py` if you want to change root directory for sample-sets, default soundcard, etc.


# How to use it

See the [FAQ](https://www.samplerbox.org/faq) on https://www.samplerbox.org.

# Notes

A few remarks:

* the current version works on Pi 2, 3, 4 (re-tested on Pi2 & Pi4 on 2022-08-09)
* the current version also works on Windows if all the required modules are installed
* MIDI via GPIO/serial should be re-tested with the current version, see https://github.com/josephernest/SamplerBox/issues/49
* 7-segment display confirmed working as of 2022-08-09, see [requirement](https://github.com/josephernest/SamplerBox/blob/916ae0a5504b0ce757d89e2ece4c65efb60b6d91/samplerbox.py#L361)

# ISO image

The ready-to-use ISO images available on [www.samplerbox.org](https://www.samplerbox.org) are built with the help of a script that can be found in `isoimage/maker.sh`.
