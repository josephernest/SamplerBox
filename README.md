[Install](#install)
----

SamplerBox works with the RaspberryPi's built-in soundcard, but it is recommended to use a USB DAC (PCM2704 USB DAC for less than 10â‚¬ on eBay is fine) for better sound quality.

1. Install the required dependencies (Python-related packages and audio libraries):

  ~~~
  sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get -y install git python-dev python-pip python-numpy cython python-smbus libportaudio2 libffi-dev
  sudo pip install rtmidi-python cffi sounddevice
  ~~~

2. Download SamplerBox and build it with:

  ~~~
  git clone https://github.com/josephernest/SamplerBox.git ;
  cd SamplerBox ; make 

3. Run the soft with `python samplerbox.py`.

4. Play some notes on the connected MIDI keyboard, you'll hear some sound!

*(Optional)*  Modify `samplerbox.py`'s first lines if you want to change root directory for sample-sets, default soundcard, etc.
